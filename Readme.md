# Basketbal Prediction and Analysis

## Project Description

The project aims to find meaningful statistics on NBA regular season historical data (about 16 years amount of data) such as average points a team makes per game or how many shots they make on average. Using this data, our project can make a number of predictions such as a team's chance of winning against another team, who might win the MVP award, etc. All values will be obtained by SSIS through Microsoft Excel, flat files, and/or web services to be stored onto MS SQL Server 2016. This data will then be analysed using SSAS. Finally, the data is processed using SSRS into easy-to-digest information.

## Technologies Used

- MS SQL Server - version 2016
- SQL Server Integration Service - Visual Studio 2017/2019
- SQL Server Analysis Service - Visual Studio 2017/2019
- SQL Server Reporting Service - Visual Studio 2017/2019
- MS ExcelBI
- MS PowerBI
- LogMeIn Hamachi
