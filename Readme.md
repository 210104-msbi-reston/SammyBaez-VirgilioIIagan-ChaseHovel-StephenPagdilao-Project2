# Basketbal Prediction and Analysis

## Project Description

The project aims to find meaningful statistics on NBA regular season historical data (about 16 years amount of data) such as average points a team makes per game or how many shots they make on average. Using this data, our project can make a number of predictions such as a team's chance of winning against another team, who might win the MVP award, etc. All values will be obtained by SSIS through Microsoft Excel, flat files, and/or web services to be stored onto MS SQL Server 2016. This data will then be analysed using SSAS. Finally, the data is processed using SSRS into easy-to-digest information.

## Technologies Used

- MS SQL Server - version 2016
- SQL Server Integration Service - Visual Studio 2017/2019
- SQL Server Analysis Service - Visual Studio 2017/2019
- SQL Server Reporting Service - Visual Studio 2017/2019
- MS ExcelBI
- MS PowerBI
- LogMeIn Hamachi

## Features

List of features

- Power BI and Excel BI report on Individual Overall Performance
- Power BI report on Individual Contribution to team performance.
- SSRS report on Team Performance
- SSRS report on Individual Performance
- SSRS report on Game Results
- SSRS report on predicted result of a game given the seasonal performance of two teams.
- SSRS report on predicted outcomes of a season
- Normalized Database on NBA statistics from 2003 to 2020.
- Multidimensional Cube of NBA statistics from 2003 to 2020 for faster querying.
- Data Mining Model on Predicting which team will will a given game.

To-do list:

- Incorporate more attributes for the data mining model to increase predictive capabilities.
- Use SQL Server Agent to automatically run SSIS packages to do some ETL processes on new NBA games.
- Incorporate more historical data from the start of the NBA.
- Create a data mining model to try to predict who will win the MVP award based on top performing players at the time and winner of the award.
- Predictive reports based on our data mining models.
- Host server on cloud
- Automatically update reports from live server

* Incorporate more attributes for the data mining model to increase predictive capabilities.
* Use SQL Server Agent to automatically run SSIS packages to do some ETL processes on new NBA games.
* Update some reports to add more interaction and useful information.
* Add detailed playoff predictions to see a teams chances of winning each individual round and their chances of winning the championship.

## Getting Started

1. Create a directory that will store the project data
2. Locate that directory in Git Bash
3. Type git init and press Enter
4. Type git pull https://github.com/210104-msbi-reston/Stephen-Pagdilao-P1.git and it will transfer everything to the folder you have specified
   (include git clone command)
   (include all environment setup steps)

> Be sure to include BOTH Windows and Unix command  
> Be sure to mention if the commands only work on a specific platform (eg. AWS, GCP)

- All the `code` required to get started
- Images of what it should look like
