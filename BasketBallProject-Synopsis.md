# Fantasy Basketball Predictions and Analysis

## Description
Our project aims to finding meaningful statistics on NBA regular season historical data (about 16 years amount of data) such as average points they get per game, how many shots did they make on average, or a prediction of their chance of winning compared to a specific team, etc. All values will be obtained by SSIS through excel, flat files, and/or web services and analyzed by SSAS and delivered by SSRS in easy to digest information and all data will be stored in MS SQL Server 2016
